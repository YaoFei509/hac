--  Special version (for HAC) of https://rosettacode.org/wiki/100_doors#Ada

--        "There are 100 doors in a row that are all initially closed.
--         You make 100 passes by the doors.
--         The first time through, visit every door and toggle the door (if the
--           door is closed, open it;   if it is open,  close it).
--         The second time, only visit every 2nd door   (door #2, #4, #6, ...),
--           and toggle it.
--         The third time, visit every 3rd door (door #3, #6, #9, ...), etc,
--           until you only visit the 100th door.
--
--   Rosetta Task: Answer the questions:
--     What state are the doors in after the last pass?
--     Which are open, which are closed?
--
--   Alternate: As noted in https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Talk:100_doors
--     the only doors that remain open are those whose numbers are perfect squares."
