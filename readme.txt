HAC - HAC Ada Compiler
======================

HAC is perhaps the first open-source (albeit very
partial) Ada compiler fully programmed in Ada itself.

More complete description in the file:  doc/hac.txt

If you are impatient: have GNAT installed, then, on your
preferred command-line interpreter:

  gnatmake -P hac

  cd exm
  ../hac gallery.adb

(for Windows, '\' are meant in place of '/')

Enjoy!
